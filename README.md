# Telecom-Churn-Prediction

Problem Statement


A telecom company is facing a high customer churn rate and wants to reduce it. Customer churn refers to the process where a customer stops doing business with a company. In the telecom industry, customer churn is a major problem as acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing customers. The company wants to use machine learning to predict which customers are likely to churn so that they can take proactive measures to retain them.
